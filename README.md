# Preburner

Minimal Vite + React + Tailwind starter that captures the Preburner domain
contracts and example data seeds.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

If installation from npm is blocked in your environment, add the required
packages manually or run the commands from a network-enabled machine.

## Project structure

- `src/types.ts` – domain contracts for profiles and planned workouts
- `src/samples/` – example profile and workout data using those contracts
- `src/App.tsx` – light UI to visualise the sample data
